# pxf-product-service
This repository is used for testing and experimenting with a new domain model for the following backend services:
- pxf-product-backend
- pxf-contract-backend
- pxf-pf-print-backend
- pxf-pf-portal-backend

## Motivation
Currently, these services lack a rich domain model and do not provide a unified API for communication between components. The goal of this project is to consolidate these services into a single service, ideally structured with multiple modules, to improve maintainability and enable richer business logic.

## Technologies
- Java
- Spring Boot
- Maven

## Code Style
This project follows the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).

## Status
Work in progress. The domain model and service consolidation are under active development.
